## Hero Project
  * Volunteer to take on big and important projects (**HERO PROJECT**). 
  * Push to get projects just a little bit bigger than you can comfortably do, so that your skills grow but you still succeed. 
  * Come up with good ideas for new projects.

## Feedback
  * Actively solicit feedback, listen to it and adapt.
  * Assume that the person giving the feedback is correct, especially if they are senior to you. 
  * If someone gives you interpersonal feedback, recognize that `they are always right`.
      * It doesn't matter if you weren't really rude and other person thought you were.  

## Others
* Work well with People. Help others do their best work.
* Don't be a jerk. Ideally, be a really nice person.
* If your manager or team are bad, change as quickly as possible.
