## Decision
* Life is sum of all the decisions

## Analysis and Paralysis
* The perfect is the enemy of the good
* The best thing is to do the right thing; The next best thing is to do wrong thing; The worst thing of all things is to `stand perfectly still`
* Give them the third best to go on with; the second best comes too late, the best never comes
* Better a good decision quickly than the best decision too late

## Decision Fatigue
* Reduction in quality of decisions after a long session of decision making. 
* Related funny paradox: People who lack choices seem to want them and often will fight for them. Yet at the same time, People find that making many choices aversive. 
* Major politicians and businessmen such as Obama, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have been known to reduce their everyday clothing down to one or two outfits in order to number of decisions they make in a day.
* Use `explore and exploit trade off wisely` in this aspect. Stop exploring in trivial aspect of your life and only exploit.
* Suggestion (Reduce the number of decisions made in a day): 
    * Dress (Tshirt, Shorts, Shoes, Watch)
    * Foods (Fix some restaraunts)
    * Grocery (Go to the same grocery shops)
    * Grooming (Soap, Shampoo, Trimmer)
    * Use common `decision templates` for managing home, relatives and other interactions
