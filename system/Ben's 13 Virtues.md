Benjamin Franklin used the following list to cultivate his character. He started this habit from childhood (age 20) and continued to practice for the rest of this life.

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week - leaving all others to their ordinary chance. 

Franklin believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, while Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many time.

1. **Temperance**: Eat not to dullness. Drink not to elevation.
2. **Silence**: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling conversation.
3. **Order**: Let all your thinkgs have their places. Let each part of your business have its time.
4. **Resolution**: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
5. **Frugality**: Make no expense but to good to others or yourself. (i.e Waste nothing)
6. **Industry**: Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary actions.
7. **Sincerity**: Use no hurtful deceit. Think innocently and justly; and if you speak, speak accordingly.
8. **Justice**: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
9. **Moderation**: Avoid extremees. Forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
10. **Cleanliness**: Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes, or habitation.
11. **Transquility**: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
12. **Chastity**: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring; never to dullness, weakness, or the injury.
13. **Humility**: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
