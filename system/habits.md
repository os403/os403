## Keystone Habit (Domino effect)
* **Keystone** is the stone that sits directly in the center of an arch and helps to interlock all of the other stones in place, while bearing the least amount of weight.
* Keystone habit is a fundamental part of any healthy habit routine. One habit (or small change) can have a chain reaction impact on multiple areas of your life. 
* For example:
    * Dress better
    * Make your bed
    * Walking or Exercise in the morning
    * Eating at home (save expenses)
    * Eating apple instead of pizza (better health)
    * Practice Gratitude
    * Meditation
* Ensure the keystone habit is the one thing followed, even in the test of time. 

## Habits

* Habits compound. Bad habits compound badly.
* A single habit is comprised of 

```
1. Cue
2. Craving
3. Routine
4. Reward
```

* Three rules help forming a habit:

```
1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy or effortless
```

* Never miss a habit `twice`. Get back to habits as soon as possible. The first rule of compounding is `never interrupt unneccarisily`
* Sometimes it is not about making good habits. It is is about breaking bad habits (Inversion rule)
* The road less travelled is `delayed gratification`. Also, the last mile is always least crowded.
* Habit stacking
* Pleasure Bundle
* Habits reinforcement
* Habits Tracking
    1. Use habits tracking carefully (Garmin for fitness, Mint for finance, etc)
    2. `Goodharts Law`: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. 
* Accountability Partner & Habit contract
    1. Have someone to watch your back
    2. Have formal contract that you will (or won't do) something by sometime. If you don't then [do something]. Have partners sign the contract. 
* Circle of Competence
    1. Use explore and exploit trade off 
    2. -OR- Split testing to figure out the circle of competence and what works for you 
* `Goldilocks Rule`: How to stay motivated in Life and work.
* use Decision Journal
* `Two minutes rule`: if some actions needs less then two minutes, then `do-it-now` on the spot

## Discipline

* Discipline will sooner or later defeat intelligence.
* When it comes to poverty, we underestimate how powerful constraint it is.
