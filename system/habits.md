## Habits

* Habits compound. Bad habits compound badly.
* A single habit is comprised of 

```
1. Cue
2. Craving
3. Routine
4. Reward
```

* Three rules aid forming a habit:

```
1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy or effortless
```

* Never miss a habit `twice`. Get back to habits as soon as possible. The first rule of compounding is `never interrupt unneccarisily`
* Sometimes it is not about making good habits. It is is about breaking bad habits (Inversion rule)
* The road less travelled is `delayed gratification`. Also, the last mile is always least crowded.
* Habit stacking
* Pleasure Bundle
* Habits reinforcement
* Habits Tracking
    1. Use habits tracking carefully (Garmin for fitness, Mint for finance, etc)
    2. `Goodharts Law`: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. 
* Accountability Partner & Habit contract
    1. Have someone to watch your back
    2. Have formal contract that you will (or won't do) something by sometime. If you don't then [do something]. Have partners sign the contract. 
* Circle of Competence
    1. Use explore and exploit trade off 
    2. -OR- Split testing to figure out the circle of competence and what works for you 
* `Goldilocks Rule`: How to stay motivated in Life and work.
* use Decision Journal
* `Two minutes rule`: if some actions needs less then two minutes, then `do-it-now` on the spot
