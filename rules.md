## Compounding effect
- Rich gets richer
- Also, called as 8th wonder of the world

## Pareto or 80/20 Principle
- 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes
- 80% of land is owned by 20% of people
- Related: Diminishing returns

##  Zipf Law
- Rank-frequency has inverse relation

##  Goldilocks rule
- Peak motiviation happens when the task is not too hard or too difficult. 
- The fine line between impossible and boring.
- Break the large and complex task into small chunks of manageble tasks. 
- This is applicable for habits as well.

## The spotlight effect
- People tend to belive that they are being noticed more than they really are
- Socially phobic people enter social situations in a heightened self-focused state, namely, from a raised emotional anchor. 
- Related: 
    - `anchoring and adjustment`: use their own internal feelings of anxiety and the accompanying self-representation as an anchor (then insufficiently correct for the fact that others are less privy to those feelings than they are themselves)
    - `illusion of transparency` overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others. Another manisfestation of the illusion of transparency is tendency to overestimate how well they understand other's personal mental states.
    - `Self-as-target bias`: believes that events are disproportionately directed towards him or herself.

## False uniqueness (& consensus) effect
- People tend to view their qualities, traits and personal attributes as unique when they are not. 
- It is even higher in `desirable traits`. People think that they are better drivers, less prejudiced than the average, or hardworking in group projects than other when they're actually not.
- Related:
    - `False consensus effect`: People tend to overestimate the extent to which their attitudes and behaviours are normal. These both are related to `self-esteeem`.
    - People tend to exprience uniqueness effects for their desirable traits, and use consensus effect to justify negative results. 

## The hindsight bias
- The decision always look obvious in hindsight
- Start using Decision Journal

## Planning fallacy
-
