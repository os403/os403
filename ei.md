    * There is only one way to avoid criticism; do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing - Aristotle
* Equanimity:
    * Know how to handle `failures`?
    * This too shall pass.
    * I'm not impacted by `negative news, people or thinking`. I'm reading good books, staying with good people and good thinking.
* Never react. Keep an emotional journal
